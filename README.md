# INST326 Final Project by Aaron Methratta, Michael Kwakye & Biruk Tamiru

As as group we created the program Password.py, a python file that will allow users to store passwords, 
check the validity of their passwords and generate random new ones. These tasks are complete by three
sperate classes called Password, Checker and Generator, a main() method exisitng outside of these
classes which is used to display prompts to the user.

To use our program, you must run the program and follow the instructions provided in the command terminal. 
Users will be able to select between three options (Store Password, Check Password, Generate Password), 
each one with their own set of features.

Here is a breakdown of the different options and their output:

Option 1) Dictionary with password number and password value, list of stored passwords.

Option 2) Information about contents of a password being checked, frequency of symbols, capital letters, lowercase letters and digits.

Option 3) Randomly generates passwords that are valid based on the criteria we have established for our program.

[Criteria for valid password: Has more than 8 characters & contains capital letters, numbers and symbols]
