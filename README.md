# INST326 Final Project by Aaron Methratta, Michael Kwakye & Biruk Tamiru

As as group we created the program Password.py, a python file that will allow users to store passwords, 
check the validity of their passwords and generate random new ones. To use our program, you must run the 
program and follow the instructions provided in the command terminal. Users will be able to select between 
three options (Store Password, Check Password, Generate Password), each one with their own set of features.
